## PythonAutomations

This project started with a need for automating simple tasks, such as verifying hashes or scripting into some firewall commands, getting reports.
I am now slowly making it public so it may help others.

Script "Get Hashes or Maliciounes":
* Get Hashes in formats sha256, sha1, md5 for purposes of inputting in different console ex: Trendmicro/Palo alto Cortex, from Virus Total
* Get maliciouness score from VT when you have too many hashes to test mannualy
